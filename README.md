# Saffman-Taylor Instability: Simulation and Experimental Study

## Overview
This project investigates the Saffman-Taylor instability, a phenomenon observed when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one in confined geometries. The study combines theoretical modeling, experimental observations using a Hele-Shaw cell, and numerical simulations to explore the mechanics of viscous fingering.

## Features
Theoretical Framework:

1.  Darcyâ€™s law for modeling flow dynamics.
2.  Stability analysis using Capillary number (Ca).

Experimental Study:

1.  Hele-Shaw cell used to visualize and analyze viscous fingering patterns.

Numerical Simulations:

1.  Simulations of pressure field and interface evolution using finite difference methods.
2.  Implementation of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) for pattern growth.

## Problem Objectives
1.  Analyze the growth and evolution of viscous fingering patterns.
2.  Quantify the effects of flow velocity, viscosity, and surface tension.
3.  Compare experimental observations with theoretical and numerical predictions.

## Results
1.  Experimental Insights: Identified the role of viscosity contrast and injection speed on finger morphology.
2.  Numerical Validation: Simulations aligned with experimental patterns and theoretical predictions.
3.  Key Findings: High Capillary numbers produce sharper, more unstable fingers; surface tension stabilizes the interface.
